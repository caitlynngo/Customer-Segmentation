# 🌟 Customer Segmentation Analysis 🛒

## 📌 Project Overview & Objective
This repository is about the second submission of BUSA3020 unit using a dataset of 4,000 customers that have been collected through loyalty cards that customers use at checkout, and includes variables such as customer age, gender, annual income, etc. This assignment requires students analyse the data in Python using relevant clustering techniques, and identify customer segments given the dataset.

## 🗂 Tools and Libraries Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
  * `Pandas`
  * `Numpy`
  * `Scikit-learn`
  * `Seaborn`
  * `Matplotlib`
  * `Scipy`
 ## 📍 Key Tasks
 * Define the problem statement and the purpose of the report, which is to analyse customer segmentation for effective marketing strategies.
 * Utilise Pandas to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), present summary statistics and relevant insights gained from the dataset.
 * Determine the optimal number of clusters by using appropriate methods including Elbow Method and Silhouette Plots.
 * Estimate the clusters using K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering, then interpret the clusters based on their profiles.
 * Summarise the key findings and provide actionable marketing strategies for each customer segment based on segmentaion analyst.

## 📓 Structure
* **Main Notebook**: This notebook includes the codes for the main part of the analysis and predictive modelling.
* **Customer Segmentation Analysis Report**: This PDF file contains the findings results and marketing techniques recommendation for each customer segment.

## 🔑 Note
This project is a part of Macquarie University - Advanced Analytics Techniques (BUSA3020) unit assignment and the dataset was provided by the unit convenor.
